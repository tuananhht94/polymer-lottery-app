# Polymer lottery app

## Logic
Users bet an amount of native token (ETH) from OP (can be extended with more chains).
After a predetermined period or upon reaching a certain funding threshold, the administrator
selects a random winner.
The reward is distributed to the winner is all fund balance on OP and ERC20 token on Base.

## Tech stack
We use NodeJS for backend, VueJS for frontend, Solidity for smart contract and
Polymer IBC.
